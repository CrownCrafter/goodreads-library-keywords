    "author_description": "Tsugumi \u014cba (Profile in Japanese: \u5927\u5834 \u3064\u3050\u307f), born in Tokyo, Japan, is a writer best known for the manga Death Note. His/her real identity is a closely guarded secret. As stated by the profile placed at the beginning of each Death Note manga, \u014cba collects teacups and develops manga plots while holding his knees on a chair, similar to a habit of L, one of the main characters of the series.There is speculation that Tsugumi \u014cba is a pen name and that he is really Hiroshi Gam\u014d. Pointing out that in Bakuman the main character's uncle was a one-hit wonder manga artist who worked on a gag super hero manga, very similar to Gam\u014d and Tottemo! Luckyman in all aspects. Also that the storyboards drawn by \u014cba greatly resemble Tottemo! Luckyman in style."
