    "author_description": "Eiichiro Oda (\u5c3e\u7530\u6804\u4e00\u90ce, Oda Eiichir\u014d) is a Japanese manga artist, best known as the creator of the manga and anime One Piece.As a child, Oda was inspired by Akira Toriyama's works and aspired to become a manga artist. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled Vicky the Viking. He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga Kinnikuman. Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.Please also see:\u5c3e\u7530\u8363\u4e00\u90ce (Chinese, simplified)\u5c3e\u7530\u69ae\u4e00\u90ce (Chinese, traditional)"
