    "author_description": "People best know French writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for his fairy tale \nThe Little Prince\n (1943). He flew for the first time at the age of 12 years in 1912 at the Amb\u00e9rieu airfield and then determined to a pilot. Even after moving to a school in Switzerland and spending summer vacations at the ch\u00e2teau of the family at Saint-Maurice-de-R\u00e9mens in east, he kept that ambition. He repeatedly uses the house at Saint-Maurice. Later, in Paris, he failed the entrance exams for the naval academy and instead enrolled at the prestigious l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1921, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, stationed in Strasbourg, began serving in the military. He learned and forever settled his career path as a pilot. After leaving the service in 1923, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry worked in several professions but in 1926 went back and signed as a pilot for A\u00e9ropostale, a private airline that from Toulouse flew mail to Dakar, Senegal. In 1927, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry accepted the position of airfield chief for Cape Juby in southern Morocco and began his first book, a memoir, called \nSouthern Mail\n and published in 1929. He then moved briefly to Buenos Aires to oversee the establishment of an Argentinean mail service, returned to Paris in 1931, and then published \nNight Flight\n, which won instant success and the prestigious Prix Femina. Always daring Saint-Exup\u00e9ry tried from Paris in 1935 to break the speed record for flying to Saigon. Unfortunately, his plane crashed in the Libyan Desert, and he and his copilot trudged through the sand for three days to find help. In 1938, a second plane crash at that time, as he tried to fly between city of New York and Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, seriously injured him. The crash resulted in a long convalescence in New York. He published \nWind, Sand and Stars\n, next novel, in 1939. This great success won the grand prize for novel of the academy and the national book award in the United States. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew reconnaissance missions at the beginning of the Second World War but went to New York to ask the United States for help when the Germans occupied his country. He drew on his wartime experiences to publish \nFlight to Arras\n and \nLetter to a Hostage\n in 1942. Later in 1943, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry rejoined his air squadron in northern Africa. From earlier plane crashes, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry still suffered physically, and people forbade him to fly, but he insisted on a mission. From Borgo, Corsica, on 31 July 1944, he set to overfly occupied region. He never returned."
